### Bulletproof Shield Rework

The Bulletproof Shield has the following changes:

- It is no longer a physical shield that you hold with one arm, but instead a small device that you can attach to your armor or clothing the size of a nicotine patch that envelops your body in an invisible protective barrier.
- The shield no longer requires an arm to hold.
- The shield's HP acts more like temporary hit points, using your base armour's SP before taking damage.
