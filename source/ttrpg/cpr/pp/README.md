# CPR Player Primer (PP)

Welcome to the "Player Primer" for Cyberpunk: RED! This guide intends to prepare new players for my CPR sessions and provide a reference for ongoing play. Keeping this page open during sessions is recommended when playing to help build good habits and keep me accountable.

Keep in mind that this guide assumes you have read the following from the **Cyberpunk: RED Core Rulebook**:

- **View from the Edge** pages 17-24 (you can skip "Streetslang")
- **Soul and the New Machine** pages 27-42
- **Fitted for the Future** pages 71-106
- **Putting the Cyber into the Punk** pages 107-120
- **Getting it Done** pages 125-166
- **Friday Night Firefight** pages 167-195
- **Netrunning** pages 195-218 (only if you're intending to do Netrunning)
- **Trauma Team** pages 219-232
