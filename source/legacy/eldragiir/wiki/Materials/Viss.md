## Prose

Viss is an extremely rare material as it is pure magical energy in a semi-stable form. At room temperature, it is a metallic viscous liquid similar to molten gold but with a faint blue glow. It is highly sought after by mages and alchemists for its unique properties. Viss is a powerful magical conductor and can store vast amounts of magical energy within it. A single vial of Viss can store the same amount of magical energy needed to cast a level 5 fireball spell.

## Uses

Viss is used in the creation of magical items, potions, and spells. It can be used to enhance the power of spells, increase the potency of potions, and imbue magical items with unique properties. Viss is also used in the creation of magical constructs and golems. It is a key component in the creation of powerful magical artifacts and weapons.

## Properties

Viss is a highly volatile material and must be handled with extreme care. It is highly reactive to magical energy and can decompose if exposed to too much magical energy at once. When Viss decomposes, it releases a massive explosion of magical energy akin to a wild magic surge. Viss is also highly toxic to living creatures and can cause severe burns and necrosis if it comes into contact with skin. It is recommended to wear protective gloves and goggles when handling Viss.

## Acquisition

Viss is extremely rare and can only be found in areas of high magical energy such as ley lines, ancient ruins, and dragon lairs. It is often guarded by powerful magical creatures as they seem to covet the material for an unknown reason. Viss can also be created artificially by distilling magical energy into a liquid form, but this process is highly dangerous and requires a skilled alchemist or mage to perform.

## Trivia

- Viss is named after the ancient elven word for "life's blood."
- Viss is said to be the tears of the creator gods, shed during the creation of the world to imbue it with magic.
- The infamous archmage, Alcazaar LaStrange, was once imprisoned within a glass orb filled with Viss as a means of containing his immense magical power. He was able to escape, however, only due to the incompetence of one of his jailers who accidentally shattered the orb with a misplaced firebolt spell.
